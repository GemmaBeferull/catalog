# FRONT END CHALLENGE REACT

##TODO
Exercise 1. Write a simple REST API in whatever language you're most
comfortable (NodeJS, Rails, Java...) that...

- has 1 endpoint /phones
- returns a couple of mobile phones like iPhone 7, Samsung Galaxy S7 etc. with
  some simple attributes like product image (just take some off of google images), title,
  description, color, price etc.
- The data can all be mocked, no need for a persistence layer

Exercise 2. Write a React app that displays the phones from the API

- Use redux for state management
- Axios(or similar library) for fetching data from the API
- Create a `PhoneListContainer` component that shows the phones
- Create a `PhoneDetailComponent` that shows a few more details about the phone
  when the user selects it
- Display a spinner or placeholder component while the API request is ongoing
- Make it look decent. No need for super sophisticated design, but at a minimum,
  make it somewhat responsive so that it doesnâ€™t look terrible on a mobile phone.

3. Push the code to a public github repo with a README.md that explains how to run
   A Exercise 1.PI & Frontend app

Bonus Points

- Dockerizing the app.
- Realistic unit/end-to-end tests.
